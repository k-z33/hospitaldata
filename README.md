🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes hospital patient and operations data using Power BI for visualization and Python for data cleaning. The aim is to uncover insights on patient care, disease distribution, hospital performance, and resource utilization.

🚀 Features

Power BI Dashboard includes:
• Bed Occupancy (ICU, General Wards)
• Patient Statistics (diagnosis, admission dates, insurance coverage)
• Disease Count (Viral Infections, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, Fractures)
• Billing & Insurance Analysis 💰
• Doctors’ patient load distribution 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️
• Tests performed (Blood test, MRI, CT Scan, Ultrasound, X-Ray)
• Hospital Rating & Performance

🛠 Tools & Skills Used

Power BI → Interactive dashboards, KPIs, visual storytelling
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) → Data cleaning & preprocessing
Data Cleaning Techniques:
• Handling missing values
• Removing duplicates
• Fixing inconsistent data types
• Outlier detection & treatment
• Grouping & aggregation for KPIs

🐍 Python Workflow
Import raw hospital dataset with Pandas
Handle null values (drop/fill methods)
Remove duplicate patient entries
Convert dates, billing amounts, insurance values into correct formats
Detect and correct outliers in billing/insurance
Export the cleaned dataset for Power BI

📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
Disease Count Chart → Top 6 diseases by patient count
Patient Statistics → Diagnosis vs Insurance Amount
Latest Admission Tracker → Updates for recent admits
Financial KPIs → Billing (190M) & Insurance (171M) overview
Resource Utilization → Bed occupancy & tests performed
Doctor Load Analysis → Patients assigned per doctor

This project demonstrates how data analytics in healthcare can:
Optimize hospital resources 🏥
Improve patient management 👩‍⚕️
Enhance financial planning 💡
Support better medical decisions 📊
